<p>Previously, you know about credit cards that banks issue. For this, you open a bank account and show your income source. After that, the bank offers you a credit card with a particular credit limit as per your income. In that credit limit, you can use funds despite if they are not available in your bank account. After that, the bank charges a specific interest on the funds you borrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years ago, when crypto was new, people were only able to withdraw funds from crypto through wire transfer and bitcoin ATMs. The reason was that no big financial company was ready to step into it. There were huge trust issues in public, too, regarding crypto.</p>
<p>Now, with time, as people are now trusting crypto, Visa and MasterCard stepped in, opening up the ways for crypto credit cards. With the advancement in crypto, you enjoy crypto credit cards the same way you use bank credit cards. There is no way in their functionality. The only difference is that, in the case of bank credit cards, you use your bank money, and in the case of crypto credit cards, you use your cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://bitcompare.net/cards"> <strong>crypto credit cards</strong></a> work in the following way. When you do a transaction, you do not pay through cryptocurrency directly. Your crypto funds are first converted into your local currency, and then you make payments for whatever you are purchasing. In this case, all the pain of currency rate and transfer is at the company and not you. So you can assume that it is all going through crypto directly.</p>
<p>You can use your crypto credit card wherever you want if the merchant supports Visa or MasterCard. With that, you can buy from a pencil to a car or anything you want. There will be no need to carry currency notes or converting your bank money to any of the currencies. So you can become worry-free and shop whatever you want.</p>
<p>By having crypto credit cards, your crypto funds become more portable. You can spend them where ever you want. Previously, this ease was not available with crypto, so people were reluctant to invest in this digital currency.</p>
